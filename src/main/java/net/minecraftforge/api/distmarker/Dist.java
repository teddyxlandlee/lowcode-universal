/**
 * A physical distribution of Minecraft. There are two common distributions, and though
 * much code is common between them, there are some specific pieces that are only present
 * in one or the other.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #CLIENT} is the <em>client</em> distribution, it contains
 *     the game client, and has code to render a viewport into a game world.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #DEDICATED_SERVER} is the <em>dedicated server</em> distribution,
 *     it contains a server, which can simulate the world and communicates via network.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Code that is only present in a specific dist is referred to as "dist-specific code", 
 * and will be marked with {@link OnlyIn}. Code that is always available is referred to 
 * as "shared code" (or "common code"). It is also common to refer to dist-specific code 
 * as "client-only code" or "server-only code" to indicate the dist.
 * <p>
 * To prevent classloading errors, it is important to ensure that {@link OnlyIn} elements are 
 * only loaded if their designated dist is the same as the executing dist.
 * <p>
 * This is done by obeying the following rules:
 * <ol>
 * <li>All dist-specific code must go in a separate class, called a "bouncer" class.</li>
 * <li>All accesses to the bouncer class must be guarded by a dist check.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * An example of these rules in action is shown below:
 * <p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Client-only bouncer class which accesses client-only code. 
 * // Methods in this class will fail verification if invoked on the wrong dist.
 * // However, the class can still be referenced from shared code as long as no methods are invoked unconditionally.
 * public class ClientBouncer
 * {
 *     public static boolean isClientSingleplayer()
 *     {
 *         // Minecraft is @OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)
 *         return Minecraft.getInstance().isSingleplayer();
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * // Class which may be loaded on either dist.
 * public class SharedClass 
 * {
 *     // Returns true if the client is playing singleplayer.
 *     // Returns false if executed on the server. Will never crash.
 *     public static boolean isClientSingleplayer()
 *     {
 *         if (currentDist.isClient())
 *         {
 *             return ClientBouncer.isClientSingleplayer();
 *         }
 *         return false;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * In this example, any code can now call {@code SharedClass.isClientSingleplayer()} without guarding.
 * <p>
 * The specifics of why this works are too complicated to be written here.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, this process can be extrapolated for use with any optional dependency.
 * 
 * @apiNote How to access the current Dist will depend on the project. When using FancyModLoader, it is in FMLEnvironment.dist
